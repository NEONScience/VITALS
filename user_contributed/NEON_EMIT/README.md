## Notebooks for working with NEON and EMIT Hyperspectral Data

These notebooks were modified from the NASA VITALS repository, but demonstrate how to download and work with NEON AOP [National Ecological Observatory Network](https://www.neonscience.org/) [Airborne Observation Platform](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/airborne-remote-sensing) and EMIT data instead of ECOSTRESS and EMIT data.

They demonstrate how to find spatially concurrent NEON [Surface Reflectance Data](https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.30006.001) and EMIT data at the Niwot Ridge site, where HYR-SENSE participants will go for the 4th day of the workshop.

The **NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS)** is an airborne [imaging spectrometer](https://www.neonscience.org/data-collection/imaging-spectrometer) built by JPL (AVIRIS-NG) and operated by the National Ecological Observatory Network's (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP). NEON's hyperspectral sensors collect measurements of sunlight reflected from the Earth's surface in 426 narrow (~5 nm) spectral channels spanning wavelengths between ~ 380 - 2500 nm. NEON's remote sensing data is intended to map and answer questions about a landscape, with ecological applications including identifying and classifying plant species and communities, mapping vegetation health, detecting disease or invasive species, and mapping droughts, wildfires, or other natural disturbances and their impacts. 

Setup instructions for running these notebooks are the same as for the main VITALS repo.
